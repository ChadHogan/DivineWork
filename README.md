# DivineWork
quick mock project working with apis for a business.

i used apython Faker library to create some fake json api files which i then outputs as a json(javascript object notation)data file. 

I then opened this in a python file using the pandas library which creates tables. i then mmerged two data streams into one table showing ordernumber and the items that were sold.

it was the outputed into three data files, excel, csv and json again.

there will be some quirks in the data but hopefully this can show in a quick time (only a couple of hours coding) what i can do
